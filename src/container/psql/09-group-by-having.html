<h1>GROUP BY AND HAVING</h1>
<h3>The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions 
(COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.</h3>
<pre>SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY column_name(s) ORDER BY column_name(s); </pre>
  
<h2>GROUP BY</h2>
<pre>SELECT COUNT(id), country FROM customer
  GROUP BY country ORDER BY COUNT(id) DESC;</pre>
<pre>SELECT Shippers.ShipperName, COUNT(Orders.OrderID) AS NumberOfOrders 
  FROM Orders
  LEFT JOIN Shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID
  GROUP BY ShipperName;</pre>
<pre>-- 출고된 연도 별로 가격의 합
SELECT SUM(price), model_year FROM car GROUP BY model_year; -- COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG 등도 사용 가능
SELECT SUM(price), customer_id FROM car GROUP BY customer_id;
</pre>  

<h2>HAVING</h2>
<h3>group by 하면 where을 사용할 수 없어 HAVING 을 사용.</h3>
<pre>SELECT column_name(s) FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY column_name(s)
  HAVING condition ORDER BY column_name(s);</pre>
<pre>SELECT COUNT(id), Country FROM Customer

FROM (Orders INNER JOIN Employees ON Orders.EmployeeID = Employees.EmployeeID)
GROUP BY LastName

<h2>SELECT DISTINCT; 중복제거</h2>
  <pre>SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
SELECT Count(DISTINCT column1) FROM table_name;</pre>
<pre>SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT city) FROM customers
  GROUP BY country; -- 중복되지 않는 CITY의 개수를 샘</pre>

<H2>중복된 모델을 가진 자동차를 삭제</H2>
